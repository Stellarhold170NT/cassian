- upstream: sandbox-quantum/switch (branch main)
- upstream_sha: 9e0e10325f091a44b21bd6234b9de0699b9497ae
- upstream_path: console/apps/switch-console-desktop/src/main

- census (measured on the PIN checkout, per extension then summed): 743 files / 130033 LOC (checklist contract: 743 files / 130033 LOC; verdict vs checklist: OK)
- generator: goldmine v16 switch p7_cut
- re-sync: per tracking/switch.md - compare 'git ls-remote https://github.com/sandbox-quantum/switch main' HEAD with upstream_sha; equal = FRESH, different = STALE (HEAD moved); re-sync is a separate decision

## Census detail (measured, per extension)

| ext | files | loc |
|---|---|---|
| ts | 743 | 130033 |
| **total** | **743** | **130033** |

## Copy scope

Whole-tree copy of every path listed in upstream_path (multi-path items mirror the upstream relative layout inside this module directory). Byte-identity of every copied file against the PIN checkout was verified with 'git diff --no-index'. The census counts only the item's code extension set per the gm-02 worker convention (py for core items; ts/tsx/js/mjs/sh for console items; the deploy bucket set yaml|yml|py|tf|hcl|sh|conf|tpl|service|setup|switch plus bare Dockerfile; md for the docs item; all files for expert-templates). Qualifiers in upstream_path (top-level *.py only; only *.md) restrict the copy exactly as written.
